List of things to improve:

Preprocessing:
 * Try EM algorithm to impute data
 * Try using median instead of means
 * Try removing columns if very little information added (might confuse certain models?)

Modelling:
 * Try to figure out why zeros are overwhelmingly in the output
 * Try balanced weights
 * Try trees (thundergbm?)
